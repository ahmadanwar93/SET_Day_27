This is a second submission to improve my first submission. The first submission simply lacks the functionality required in the question. I have added password hashing in this version as well. Furthermore, the employee can only log his/her time without the ability to see all other employee's attendance log. The power to do so only reserved to the admin. The user name and password of both employee and admin is not hard coded as in the first version, rather this version will compare the user input with the record saved in the mysql database. The major improvement that I can do next is to properly style the page using CSS. Moreover, the admin can edit the time log of the record selected. However, the admin can only update the time into the current time stamp. So, it definitely lacks the flexibility. Lastly, I also want to implement user registration function, so that before the user login into the system, there is an option for the user to register as a new user.
